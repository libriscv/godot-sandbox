# GDScript Compiler IR Optimizations

This document describes the IR-level optimizations implemented in the GDScript-to-RISC-V compiler, along with planned future optimizations.

## Overview

The optimizer operates on the intermediate representation (IR) before RISC-V code generation. Multiple optimization passes run iteratively to reduce code size, eliminate redundancy, and improve runtime performance.

## Currently Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Constant Folding
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Medium

Evaluates constant expressions at compile time instead of runtime.

**Example:**
```gdscript
var x = 5 + 10  # Compiled as: x = 15
var y = 2.0 * 3.0  # Compiled as: y = 6.0
```

**IR Transformation:**
```
Before:
  LOAD_IMM r1, 5
  LOAD_IMM r2, 10
  ADD r0, r1, r2

After:
  LOAD_IMM r0, 15
```

**Details:**
- Handles integer and float arithmetic
- Supports comparison operations
- Respects GDScript type promotion (int + float → float)
- Avoids division by zero

### 2. Copy Propagation
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Low-Medium

Eliminates redundant MOVE instructions after constant loads.

**IR Transformation:**
```
Before:
  LOAD_IMM r0, 5
  MOVE r1, r0
  # r0 never used again
  ADD r2, r1, r3

After:
  LOAD_IMM r1, 5
  ADD r2, r1, r3
```

### 3. Enhanced Copy Propagation
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (New!)
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Medium

Advanced copy propagation that tracks copy chains and propagates sources through uses.

**Example:**
```gdscript
var a = x
var b = a
return b  # Can use x directly
```

**IR Transformation:**
```
Before:
  MOVE r1, r0
  CMP_LT r3, r1, r2  # Uses r1

After:
  MOVE r1, r0
  CMP_LT r3, r0, r2  # Uses r0 directly
```

**Details:**
- Follows copy chains to original source
- Verifies source register hasn't been modified
- Clears tracking at control flow boundaries
- Handles special case for BRANCH_ZERO/BRANCH_NOT_ZERO

### 4. Loop-Invariant Code Motion (LICM)
**Status:** ✅ Implemented (New!)
**Safety:** Safe
**Impact:** High (for simple loops)
**Limitation:** Currently disabled for functions with nested loops

Moves loop-invariant computations outside of loops to avoid redundant execution.

**Example:**
```gdscript
while i < 10:  # "10" is loop-invariant
    i = i + 1  # "1" is loop-invariant
```

**IR Transformation:**
```
Before:
  LABEL @loop
    LOAD_IMM r2, 10     # Executed every iteration
    CMP_LT r3, r1, r2
    BRANCH_ZERO r3, @end
    LOAD_IMM r5, 1      # Executed every iteration
    ADD r0, r0, r5
    JUMP @loop
  LABEL @end

After:
  LOAD_IMM r2, 10       # Hoisted out
  LOAD_IMM r5, 1        # Hoisted out
  LABEL @loop
    CMP_LT r3, r1, r2
    BRANCH_ZERO r3, @end
    ADD r0, r0, r5
    JUMP @loop
  LABEL @end
```

**Details:**
- Identifies loops via back edges (JUMP to earlier labels)
- Only hoists pure operations (LOAD_IMM, LOAD_FLOAT_IMM, LOAD_BOOL, LOAD_STRING, MOVE)
- Verifies destination register not read before definition
- Verifies source registers not modified anywhere in loop
- Iteratively finds transitive invariants
- **Skips entire function if any nested loops detected** (conservative approach to avoid hoisting past wrong loop headers)

### 5. Peephole Optimization
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Medium

Pattern-based local optimizations on small instruction windows.

**Patterns:**
- Eliminate self-moves: `MOVE r0, r0` → *removed*
- Collapse move chains around operations
- Remove redundant move pairs: `MOVE r1, r0; MOVE r0, r1` → *removed*
- Optimize common patterns like `count = count + 1`

### 6. Redundant Store Elimination
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Safety:** Safe
**Impact:** Low-Medium

Removes dead stores and consecutive identical stores.

**Example:**
```
LOAD_IMM r0, 10
LOAD_IMM r0, 20  # First store is dead

→

LOAD_IMM r0, 20
```

### 7. Dead Code Elimination
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Safety:** Conservative (safe)
**Impact:** Low

Removes instructions that produce unused values.

**Details:**
- Only eliminates truly pure operations (LOAD_IMM, LOAD_BOOL)
- Conservative to avoid breaking control flow or side effects
- Tracks live registers through the function

## Planned Future Optimizations

### 8. Common Subexpression Elimination (CSE)
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Safe
**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** High

Detect and reuse previously computed values.

**Example:**
```
ADD r1, r0, r2
...
ADD r3, r0, r2  # Same computation

→

ADD r1, r0, r2
...
MOVE r3, r1     # Reuse
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Track available expressions with their result registers
- Invalidate on register writes
- Only for pure operations

### 9. Strength Reduction
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Moderate (requires type hints)
**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** Medium

Replace expensive operations with cheaper equivalents.

**Examples:**
```
MUL r0, r1, 2   →  ADD r0, r1, r1    (for type-hinted ints)
DIV r0, r1, 4   →  SRA r0, r1, 2     (for type-hinted ints)
MUL r0, r1, 0   →  LOAD_IMM r0, 0
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Only safe with proper type hints
- Must respect GDScript semantics (int vs float)
- Be careful with overflow/underflow

### 10. Algebraic Simplifications
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Low-Medium
**Priority:** Medium

Apply algebraic identities to simplify expressions.

**Examples:**
```
ADD r0, r1, 0    →  MOVE r0, r1
MUL r0, r1, 1    →  MOVE r0, r1
MUL r0, r1, 0    →  LOAD_IMM r0, 0
SUB r0, r1, 0    →  MOVE r0, r1
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Very safe for integers
- Be careful with NaN/infinity for floats

### 11. Branch Simplification
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Safe
**Impact:** Low
**Priority:** Low

Simplify redundant branch patterns.

**Example:**
```
CMP_LT r0, r1, r2
BRANCH_ZERO r0, @skip
LOAD_BOOL r0, 1
JUMP @cont
LABEL @skip
LOAD_BOOL r0, 0
LABEL @cont

→

CMP_LT r0, r1, r2  # Already produces bool
```

### 12. Dead Label Elimination
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Low (code size only)
**Priority:** Low

Remove labels that are never jumped to.

**Implementation:**
- Scan all JUMP/BRANCH instructions for target labels
- Remove unreferenced labels

### 13. Type-Hint Propagation
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Safe
**Impact:** Medium (enables other opts)
**Priority:** High

Track and propagate type hints through the IR.

**Example:**
```
LOAD_IMM r0, 5        # Mark as INT
LOAD_IMM r1, 10       # Mark as INT
ADD r2, r0, r1        # Propagate INT type hint
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables strength reduction
- Allows specialized codegen for known types
- Can skip dynamic type checks in VEVAL

### 14. Safe Register Renumbering
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Moderate (must preserve ABI)
**Impact:** Low (reduces stack frame size)
**Priority:** Low

Compact virtual register numbering while preserving calling convention.

**Current Issue:**
The existing `reduce_register_pressure()` is disabled because it breaks the calling convention (parameters in r0-r6, return in r0).

**Implementation Plan:**
- Preserve r0-r6 for parameters and return value
- Only renumber temporary registers (r7+)
- Track register lifetime intervals
- Compact non-overlapping lifetimes

### 15. Induction Variable Optimization
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Moderate
**Impact:** High (for counted loops)
**Priority:** Medium

Optimize loop counter variables.

**Example:**
```gdscript
for i in range(10):
    array[i] = i * 2
```

**Optimizations:**
- Strength reduction: `i * 2` → increment by 2
- Dead code elimination if induction variable unused after loop

### 16. Load/Store Coalescing
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Safe
**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** Medium

Merge adjacent stack operations targeting the same Variant.

**Already partially implemented** in `eliminate_redundant_stores()` but could be enhanced.

## Gaps Found by Inspection

Four things the optimizer leaves on the floor, found by dumping the IR of the
79 corpus programs in `tests/test_corpus.h` and reading what came out. Each has
a minimal reproduction and a count over that corpus, so the work can be
prioritised against evidence rather than guessed at. They are listed in the
order they should be done: 17 is what makes 18 fire, and 18 is what makes 19
and 20 have anything to remove.

### 17. Keep Constants Across a Label
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Moderate (needs a real join-point rule)
**Impact:** High
**Priority:** High

`constant_folding()` clears everything it knows at every `LABEL`. A label is a
join point and a value arriving on two paths is genuinely unknown -- but the
reset is unconditional, so a register no path writes loses its constant too.
The effect is that constant folding stops at the first `if`, loop or `match` in
a function, which in a real program is almost immediately.

```gdscript
func test():
	var a = 4
	var b = 9
	return a + b          # LOAD_IMM r0, 13
```
```gdscript
func test(n):
	var a = 4
	var b = 9
	if n:                 # neither a nor b is touched here
		pass
	return a + b          # ADD r0, r1, r2 -- both operands still constant
```

The narrow fix is to keep an entry across a label when no instruction anywhere
in the function writes that register. The general fix is to intersect the state
over the label's actual predecessors.

### 18. Fold a Branch on a Constant Condition
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** High
**Priority:** High

`BRANCH_ZERO` and `BRANCH_NOT_ZERO` are on the never-folded list in
`constant_folding()`, so a condition that folded to a constant still gets
tested at run time and the arm it guards still gets emitted. 14 sites in 10 of
the 79 corpus programs, all of them created by folding the comparison directly
above:

```
2: LOAD_BOOL    r5, 0
3: BRANCH_ZERO  r5, @ternary_else_0    # always taken; 4, 5 and the label are dead
4: LOAD_IMM     r2, 4
5: JUMP         @ternary_end_1
6: LABEL        @ternary_else_0
7: MOVE         r2, r1
```

A constant `BRANCH_*` becomes a `JUMP` or nothing at all. Entry 11 (Branch
Simplification) is a different pattern -- it is about a comparison that
materialises a bool; this is about a branch whose answer is already known.

### 19. Drop Unreachable Code After RETURN and JUMP
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Low (code size), rises once 18 lands
**Priority:** Medium

Nothing removes the instructions between a `RETURN` or `JUMP` and the next
`LABEL`. `if/return/else` produces one per arm, and they reach machine code:

```
15: RETURN
16: JUMP  @endif_5              # nothing can execute this
```
```
100ac:  00008067   ret
100b0:  1580006f   j 10208      # and here it is in the ELF
```

27 sites in 7 corpus programs; `classify()` in `if_elif_else` carries three.
`eliminate_dead_code()` works on registers nothing reads, which is a different
question from code nothing reaches.

### 20. Drop a Branch to the Next Instruction
**Status:** 🔜 Planned
**Safety:** Very Safe
**Impact:** Low
**Priority:** Low

A `JUMP` or `BRANCH_*` whose target label is the instruction directly after it
is a no-op. 11 sites in 9 corpus programs, mostly the last arm of a `match`
jumping to the end label that immediately follows it. Cheap to spot in
`peephole_optimization()`, and worth doing after 19 rather than before: 19
creates more of them.

## Optimization Pipeline Order

The optimizations run in this order (with iteration):

1. **Constant Folding** - Enables downstream optimizations
2. **Copy Propagation** - Basic cleanup
3. **Enhanced Copy Propagation** - Advanced cleanup
4. **Loop-Invariant Code Motion** - Hoist invariants
5. **Peephole Optimization** - Local patterns
6. **Peephole Optimization** - Second pass for new patterns
7. **Redundant Store Elimination** - Before dead code
8. **Peephole Optimization** - Final cleanup
9. **Dead Code Elimination** - Remove unused code

## Why Register Allocation Doesn't Help (Currently)

The compiler has a sophisticated register allocator that assigns 18 physical RISC-V registers (t0-t6, s1-s11) to virtual registers. However, **the RISC-V codegen is entirely stack-based and ignores these allocations**.

### Current Codegen Approach

All operations:
1. Load Variants from stack
2. Operate using only `t0` as scratch register
3. Store results back to stack

**Example from generated assembly:**
```asm
ld   t0, 24(sp)      # Load from stack
sd   t0, 48(sp)      # Store to stack
ld   t0, 32(sp)      # Load from stack
sd   t0, 56(sp)      # Store to stack
# ... only t0 is used!
```

### Why This Approach Was Chosen

The Variant ABI is complex:
- Variants are 24 bytes (type + padding + 16-byte data)
- Register passing would require unpacking/packing
- System calls operate on Variant pointers (stack addresses)
- Using `vmcallv()` keeps everything Variant-based

### Future: Register-Based Codegen

A future optimization could leverage register allocation for:
- **Type-hinted scalars**: Keep int/float in registers directly
- **Reference tracking**: Keep object IDs in registers
- **Specialized operations**: Fast paths for known types

This would require:
- Type hint propagation (planned optimization #13)
- Specialized IR opcodes for typed operations
- Codegen that generates different code for hinted vs dynamic paths

## Performance Notes

### Optimization Impact on Loop Performance

For a simple counting loop (`while i < 10: i = i + 1`):
- **LICM** reduces per-iteration instruction count by ~20%
- **Enhanced copy propagation** eliminates redundant MOVE instructions
- Combined: Significant reduction in loop overhead

### Current Bottleneck

The main bottleneck is the stack-based Variant codegen, not the IR optimizations. Future work should focus on:
1. Type-hint propagation
2. Specialized codegen for hinted types
3. Register-based fast paths

## Contributing

When adding new optimizations:

1. **Safety First**: Ensure the optimization preserves semantics
2. **Add Tests**: Both unit tests (CMake) and integration tests
3. **Document**: Update this file with examples and impact analysis
4. **Benchmark**: Measure actual performance impact
5. **Iterate**: Consider interaction with existing passes
